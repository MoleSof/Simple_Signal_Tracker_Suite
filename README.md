# WIFI Signal Tracker Suite

-Repo for finding the direction of a signal using directional antenna's or antenna movement over time. 

-General SDR support (coming soon)

# -NO AI CODE!

#TODO add supported arm amd64 i386 etc to each name. note nmcli works on ARM architecture. refer too: https://www.kismetwireless.net/packages/

# Important Notes For Use:

-At this time some of the script's only runs with each line run by itself in a terminal in general (Signal_Strength_Logger.sh dose run fully at this point once depends are installed 'nmcli'). Even after that is patched out if any issues are encountered it's best to run it that way anyway will try to make it log so you can at least start where it left off manually.

# -Some Parts are extremely incomplete, use at your own risk.
